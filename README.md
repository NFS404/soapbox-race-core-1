A SoapBox Race World core fork for World Evolved v2 server.

## Notes:

* Does not feature the economy (rewards) settings.
* This core version can be builded and started on actual Wildfly server, but it may doesn't have necessary SQL data. I will fix this and publish ready-to-use build later (I hope).
