A SoapBox Race World core fork for World Evolved v2 server.

## Notes:

* Currently i don't have a permissions to upload Achievement system (made by Nilzao). Use ApexSBRW's one instead.
* Does not feature the economy (rewards) settings.
* This core version probably can't be builded and started on actual Wildfly server. It may doesn't have necessary SQL data. I will fix this and publish ready-to-use build later (I hope).
